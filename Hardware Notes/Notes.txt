Digispark:
 - PWM output on P1
 - ADC input on P2
 - Remove LED from P1
 
Dimmer:
 - Cut trace from pot centre pin to LM358 +ve terminal
 - Cut trace from LM358 -ve terminal to anything else (before resistor & cap)
 - Add resistive divider from 5V to GND to supply 2.5V to LM358 +ve pin
 - Remove R15
 
Interconnects:
 - Tap 12V from dimmer into Vin on Digispark
 - Tap GND from dimmer into GND on Digispark
 - Tap pot centre pin to ADC input on Digispark (P2)
 - Tap LM358 -ve pin from dimmer to PWM output from Digispark (P1)
